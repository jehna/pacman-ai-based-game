# Pac-Man AI based game
> A simple game intended to run in mobile, with huge respect to the original
> Pac-Man game and its creator Toru Iwatani.

Currently very early stage testing and prototyping. Might get somewhere, or
then again it might not.

## A big picture

Here's the big picture that this game might try to accomplish:
- Respect the original Pac-Man's great game design and AI, that made the game so
  awesome.
- Try to proudly add some value to bring the game to 21st century
- Use nice, clean graphics
- Spend a bunch of hours perfecting the animations to the max
- Make the character move with swipes, making the game easy to be paused and
  continued.

## Contributions
First get familiar with [the original Pac-Man's AI][1] and game design.

Contributions are warmly welcome via pull requests.

Please open an issue beforehand and use feature branches.

## License
This work is not currently under any license, but if/when the first collaborator
gets interested or the game gets more mature, I'm happy to openly discuss
different possible licenses.
