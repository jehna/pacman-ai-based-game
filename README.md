# Pac-Man AI based game
> A simple game intended to run in mobile, with huge respect to the original
> Pac-Man game and its creator Toru Iwatani.

This was a MVP version of an idea I wanted to test. As this concept did not work
as intended, this code is released with MIT license.

Please note that for the time being, I have no intention to continue this game,
but I'm ofc open to any ideas you might come up with.

## A big picture

Here's the big picture that this game might try to accomplish:
- Respect the original Pac-Man's great game design and AI, that made the game so
  awesome.
- Try to proudly add some value to bring the game to 21st century
- Use nice, clean graphics
- Spend a bunch of hours perfecting the animations to the max
- Make the character move with swipes, making the game easy to be paused and
  continued.
